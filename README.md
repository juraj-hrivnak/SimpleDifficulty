# SimpleDifficulty for Underdog
Fork of SimpleDifficulty.

- Added salt water and regular water. Vanilla water is now treated as spring water. (The water itself must be generated using another mod. Cave Generator is recommended).
- Added compatibility for Biomes O' Plenty and Greenery aquatic plants.
- Added Fluidlogged API compatibility.
- Added biome water colors to waters.
- Added new config option to make waters darker/brighter.
- Added compatibility to the Streams mod.
- Added salt / fresh water mixing logic with an optimized fill algorithm that doesn't affect performance.
- Improved water fog visuals. The fog colour is more bright now and changes depending on the biome.
- Hypothermia and Hyperthermia now reduce the max health and add negative potion effects instead of dealing damage.
